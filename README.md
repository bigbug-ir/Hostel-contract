# Hostel Contract

A smart contract project for managing hostel-related functionalities such as booking, payment, and management using blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Decentralized Booking**: Hostel bookings managed through the blockchain.
- **Payment System**: Payments are securely handled via smart contracts.
- **Upgradability**: Built with a modular architecture for future enhancements.
- **Secure**: Follows best practices for security in smart contract development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- **Metamask**: For deploying and interacting with the contract.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bigbug-ir/Hostel-contract.git
   cd Hostel-contract
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Deployment

1. Configure your `.env` file:
   ```env
   INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   ```

2. Compile the smart contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. Deploy to a network (e.g., Rinkeby):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
   ```

### Testing

Run tests to ensure the contract behaves as expected:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on your desired blockchain network.
2. Interact with the contract using a frontend application or a script.
3. Use tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Hardhat Console](https://hardhat.org/guides/console.html) for manual interactions.

## File Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contracts.
